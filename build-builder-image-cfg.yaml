  description: PipelineRun building the buildpack builder image using pack CLI

  # Remark : As the Pipelin(run) resource of konflux already defines mandatory steps to perform actions as listed here - it is then not needed
  # to detail them here except the actions that you want to include part of the build process

  # The actions to be executed should match/map the name ofg the Task declared in an OCI Bundle or Git repository url
  # Examples:
  # - pack: to build an image using the Pack CLI
  # - build: to build an application using a builder image
  # - pack-builder: to create a builder image using pack CLI
  # - stack: to create a base stack image build or run
  # - meta/composite: to package the buildpacks of a "meta/composite" buildpack project
  # - buildpack: to package a "buildpack" project
  # - extension: to package an "extension" project
  # TODO: List of the examples should be reviewed !
  actions:
    - name: pack-builder # TODO: To be reviewed as the name of the task is different about the "build-container"
